## Control flow statements in C++

- **if** (and i**f**/**else**) statements
- **for** loops
- **range for** loops. Introduced in C++11. Like “foreach”

```c++
 for (init; decl : expr)
```

- **while** (and **do**/**while**) loops
- **switch** statements
- **goto** statement (You should never need or use this!)
- Later on we will see how to make use of STL algorithms instead of loops.
- C++20 also incorporates the ranges library.
